<p>
Welcome to Sorting Visualizer! I built this application because I was fascinated by algorithms, and I wanted to visualize them in action. I hope that you enjoy playing around with this visualization tool just as much as I enjoyed building it. You can access it here https://algorithms-visualization.web.app

<h2>Meet the Algorithms</h2>
<ul>
      <li> 
         <b>Quick</b> is a divide-and-conquer algorithm. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then sorted recursively. This can be done in-place, requiring small additional amounts of memory to perform the sorting.
      </li>
      <li> 
         <b>Merge</b> is an efficient, general-purpose, comparison-based sorting algorithm. Most implementations produce a stable sort, which means that the order of equal elements is the same in the input and output.
