<h1>Pathfinding-Visualizer</h1>

<p>
Welcome to Pathfinding Visualizer! I built this application because I was fascinated by pathfinding algorithms, and I wanted to visualize them in action. I hope that you enjoy playing around with this visualization tool just as much as I enjoyed building it. You can access it here (use Google Chrome!): https://algorithms-visualization.web.app

<h2>Meet the Algorithms</h2>
<ul>
   <h3> Path-finding </h3> 
   <li>
    <b> Dijkstra's Algorithm </b>: A naive way of searching for end node and the father of pathfinding algorithms, guarantees       the shortest path.
  </li>
  <li> 
    <b>A* Search</b> : arguably the best pathfinding algorithm; uses heuristics to guarantee the shortest path much faster       than Dijkstra's Algorithm 
  </li>
   <h3> Sorting </h3>
      <li> 
         <b>Bubble</b> ssort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order.
      </li>
      <li> 
         <b>Insertion</b> sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time.
      </li>
<small>More Comming soon! (You can make suggestions as well :) )</small>
</ul>
