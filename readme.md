# Sorting Visualizer :fire:

Sorting algorithms visualizer in Vanilla JavaScript

<p>
Welcome to Algorithms Visualizer! I built this application because I was fascinated by algorithms, and I wanted to visualize them in action. I hope that you enjoy playing around with this visualization tool just as much as I enjoyed building it. You can access it here (use Google Chrome!): https://algorithms-visualization.web.app

      <b>Merge sort</b> sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order.
   </li>
   <li>
